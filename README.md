# MPU6050 to InfluxDB

This is a personal project related to a school team project where we were asked to experiment with MPU6050 and ESP8266 NodeMCU. Its a copy paste job by combining a basic CPP code from https://www.electronicwings.com/nodemcu/mpu6050-interfacing-with-nodemcu and a sample code from https://github.com/tobiasschuerg/InfluxDB-Client-for-Arduino

The project consists of two items

# Docker Compose file
Its a simple docker-compose.yml file for where I run Grafana and Influx DB

# ino file
This is an ino file for Arduino IDO written in CPP
